# ROP Optimization Using Machine Learning by Faiz Muzakki
This repository contains the code and resources for my Bachelor's thesis titled "Rate of Penetration (ROP) Optimization Using Machine Learning for Wells A-3, A-4, and A-5 in the "AFMH" Field."

The main goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that analyze drilling parameters from wells A-3, A-4, and A-5 in the "AFMH" Field to optimize the Rate of Penetration (ROP). By leveraging data analytics and predictive modeling, this work aims to enhance drilling efficiency by identifying the optimal range of drilling parameters needed to maximize ROP.

The project is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, utilizing popular libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn for data processing, model development, and visualization of predicted drilling parameters values.

This repository is intended as a resource for researchers, students, industry professionals, and engineers in the oil and gas industry interested in the application of machine learning techniques for drilling optimization.
